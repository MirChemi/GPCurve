This program is designed to show and calculate peaks based on files generated by Chromeleon software.

To run this program:
1) Download program (e.g. Code->Download ZIP. Then unpack)
2) Install python3
3) Install all needed dependencies (clipboard, numpy, pdfplumber, matplotlib, scipy, tkinterdnd2): use pip install 'insert module' (e.g. from command line)
4) Run main.py (e.g. from command line)

To use this program:
1) Have xxx.pdf and xxx.txt in the same folder (see example)
2) Have pdf file containing constants or folder containing these files named like yearmounthdate[RI-or-UV] (see constants_example)

Tips
1) Graphs are lgM scaled
2) Black dash - bulk data
3) Colored dashdot - baseline
4) Colored line - peak
5) Uncheck 'new figure' to locate spectra on the same picture
6) Use 'ADD GAUSS' button to fit gauss curve(s) with spectra
7) 'fix lg intensity' corrects nonlinear dependency between lgM and vol
8) 'clear plot' only places bulk data on the plot
9) 'Save to csv' button saves to folder with xxx.pdf and xxx.txt
10) Press 'Show 2nd der' on graph to view second derivative and manually find peaks by its minimum
11) Peaks characteristics are shown in gui console

Have fun).
