This program is designed to calculate peaks based on files generated by Chromelion software.

To run this program:
1) Install python3
2) Install all needed dependencies (from import section): use pip install
3) Run the program (e.g. from command line)

To use this program:
1) Have xxx.pdf and xxx.txt in the same folder (see example)
2) Have pdf file containing constants or folder containing these files named like yearmounthdate[RI-or-UV] (see constants_example)

Tips
1) Graphs are lgM scaled
2) black dash - bulk data
3) colored dashdot - baseline
4) colored line - peak
5) uncheck 'new figure' to locate spectra on the same picture
6) peaks characteristics are shown in console
7) 'fix lg intensity' corrects nonlinear dependency between lgM and vol
8) -C - don't touch constants file/folder


Have fun).
